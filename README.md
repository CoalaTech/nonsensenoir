Prototype of an adventure game. This is an old code that is being refactored and soon will become a full game.

## How to start the game
 The project is using grunt and bower, so you need to run `npm install` and `bower install` first.
 Then, just run `grunt` and visit:
 
 `http://localhost:9000/build/index.html`

 PS: This is not a fully playable game yet.
